# Changelog

All notable changes to Locus are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once releases start.

## [Unreleased]

The first public version of the source. Highlights:

### Models
- Anthropic Messages, OpenAI Responses and OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenRouter, Groq, Google Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, vLLM), with streaming, prompt caching, token accounting and compaction.
- Continue with ChatGPT: use a ChatGPT Plus or Pro plan through OpenAI's Sign in with ChatGPT program.
- On-device Gemma 4 through LiteRT-LM, with image input and KV-cache reuse.
- A helper model for titles, follow-up suggestions, summaries and the optional safety reviewer.

### Chat
- Message branching: regenerate a reply or edit a message as a new branch, and switch between versions with ‹ 1/2 ›; only the shown branch is sent to the model.
- Fork a chat from any reply or message into a new chat with the same settings.
- Full-text search over messages (SQLite FTS5, database v8): words match from their start ("kotl" finds "Kotlin"), "quoted phrases" match exactly, accents and case are ignored. Results show each chat once, newest match first, with the matching words highlighted. Only what you'd search is indexed: your messages, attached file names and replies, not tool output or reasoning. `chat_history_search` uses the same index. Existing chats are indexed when the app updates.

### Agent
- Agent loop with per-tool Allow / Ask / Deny policies, approvals in the app or from notifications, and recovery after the app is killed.
- Plan mode, a todo checklist, and thinking shown live and kept afterwards.
- Sub-agents: researcher, coder, explorer, ops and browser helpers that run in parallel, plus your own definitions.
- Memory, Agent Skills, HTTP connectors with sandboxed scripts, MCP servers with OAuth, and drafts you approve.

### Tools
- Linux workspace (Alpine under proot), SSH and SFTP with detached jobs, phone actions through intents.
- Agent browser: structured snapshots with stable refs, form filling, waits, tabs, dialogs, downloads and uploads through the workspace, page saving and logs, with confirmations for logins, payments and submits.
- Integrations: Firecrawl, Tavily, Brave, Exa, GitHub, Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, email and ntfy.
- `cloudflare_deploy_static` publishes a workspace folder (such as `dist`) as a Cloudflare Workers static site on workers.dev, with single-page-app routing and missing-file-only uploads. It always asks first. The token needs Account → Workers Scripts → Edit.

### App
- Onboarding with a persona questionnaire, a settings hub, Library, scheduled tasks, a workspace with file viewers, Activity runs with search and filters, and Insights.
- One design system across every screen, with real provider, model and file-type icons.

### Model picker
- One search across every provider's models, favourites (star a model) and recent picks on top.
- Rows show the model's logo, its display name, and chips for context window, vision, tools and reasoning where known.
- Optional model details from the public [models.dev](https://models.dev) catalogue: off until you turn it on, fetched at most once a day, cached for offline use.

### Project
- Debug APKs are published to GitHub Releases from version tags (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

### Changed
- The system prompt tells the agent never to ask for API keys or tokens in the chat and to point to the missing setting instead (new chats only).
- `cloudflare_pages_deploy` now says plainly that it can't upload files.

### Fixed
- Opening the browser full screen crashed the app when the page had focus.
- The terminal and browser buttons now show only when their panel has something to show.
- A chat that ends on your message (after an error was dismissed) offers Run again.
- The model sheet could show no tick while the chat header named a model: when the chosen model later became the provider's default, or when the provider's list didn't include it. Header, sheet and requests now resolve the model the same way (#1).
- A model picked on home just before sending could miss that chat and carry over to the next one.

### Fixed (before the first push)
- The full-screen browser showed a black page after opening it from a chat.
- Browser sign-ins failed with "Unable to resolve host" when finishing in the background.
- ChatGPT replies disappeared after streaming.
